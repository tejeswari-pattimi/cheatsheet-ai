# CheatSheet AI: The Free, Open-Source Alternative to Expensive Interview Tools

## Introduction: Breaking Down the $200/Month Barrier

If you've ever looked into AI-powered coding interview assistants, you've probably seen the price tags: $60, $100, even $200 per month for subscription-based tools. These premium services promise to help you ace technical interviews with invisible overlays, instant code generation, and AI-powered debugging. But what if I told you there's a completely free, open-source alternative that not only matches these features but actually surpasses them in several key areas?

Meet **CheatSheet AI** – a powerful, privacy-focused desktop application that puts you in control of your interview preparation without the recurring subscription fees.

## What Makes CheatSheet AI Different?

### 1. **You Own Your Data (and Your Wallet)**

Unlike subscription-based services that process everything on their servers, CheatSheet AI runs entirely on your machine. You bring your own Groq API key, and you only pay for what you use. No monthly subscriptions, no hidden fees, no vendor lock-in.

**Cost Comparison:**
- Premium Tools: $60-200/month (fixed cost regardless of usage)
- CheatSheet AI: $0/month + your actual API usage (typically $2-10/month for moderate use)

### 2. **True Multi-AI Support**

Most paid tools lock you into a single AI provider. CheatSheet AI gives you the freedom to choose:

- **Groq**: Llama 4 Maverick vision model for fast image analysis

### 3. **Invisible When It Needs to Be**

CheatSheet AI features an undetectable overlay that bypasses most screen capture methods:

✅ **Invisible to:**
- Zoom (versions below 6.1.6)
- All browser-based screen recording
- Discord screen sharing
- macOS screenshot tools (Cmd+Shift+3/4)

⚠️ **Visible to:**
- Zoom 6.1.6+ (but you can downgrade)
- macOS native screen recording (Cmd+Shift+5)

The application gives you complete control over window opacity, positioning, and visibility with intuitive keyboard shortcuts.

## Core Features That Actually Matter

### Quick Answer Mode: The One-Key Solution

Press `Ctrl+D` and watch the magic happen:
1. Automatically resets any previous work
2. Captures a screenshot of your current screen
3. Processes it through AI
4. Delivers a complete solution with explanation

All in one keystroke. No clicking through menus, no multi-step workflows. Just instant results.

### Smart Question Detection

CheatSheet AI automatically identifies what type of problem you're working on:

- **Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)**: Analyzes options and provides the correct answer with reasoning
- **Python/Coding Problems**: Generates optimized solutions with detailed explanations
- **Web Development**: Creates complete HTML/CSS matching design screenshots
- **Text Questions**: Provides comprehensive written answers

No need to manually specify the question type – the AI figures it out.

### Advanced Screenshot Workflow

For more complex problems, use the manual mode:

1. **Capture Multiple Screenshots** (`Ctrl+H`): Take up to 2 screenshots of different parts of the problem
2. **Review Your Queue**: See thumbnails of captured screenshots
3. **Delete if Needed** (`Ctrl+Backspace`): Remove the last screenshot if you made a mistake
4. **Process Together** (`Ctrl+Enter`): Analyze all screenshots as a single context

This is perfect for problems that span multiple screens or require capturing both the question and starter code.

### Conversational Debugging

Got an error? Don't start over – just debug:

1. Take a screenshot of your error message
2. The AI analyzes what went wrong
3. Get structured feedback with:
   - Identified issues
   - Corrected code
   - Optimization suggestions
   - Detailed explanations

It's like having a senior developer looking over your shoulder.

### Web Development Superpowers

For front-end interviews, CheatSheet AI is a game-changer:

- **Screenshot to Code**: Capture a design mockup, get complete HTML/CSS
- **Separate Copy Functions**: 
  - `Ctrl+Shift+C` copies HTML
  - `Ctrl+Shift+D` copies CSS
- **Auto-Type Clipboard** (`Ctrl+Shift+V`): Bypasses paste restrictions by typing the content character-by-character

No more manually recreating designs or struggling with paste-blocked environments.

## The Complete Keyboard Shortcut Arsenal

CheatSheet AI is built for speed. Here's your complete reference:

### Essential Actions
- `Ctrl+D` – Quick Answer (capture + process in one)
- `Ctrl+H` – Take Screenshot
- `Ctrl+Enter` – Process Screenshots
- `Ctrl+R` – Reset/Clear Everything
- `Ctrl+Backspace` – Delete Last Screenshot

### Window Control
- `Ctrl+B` or `Alt+1` – Toggle Visibility
- `Ctrl+Q` – Quit Application
- `Ctrl+Arrow Keys` – Move Window
- `Ctrl+[` / `Ctrl+]` – Adjust Opacity
- `Ctrl+-` / `Ctrl+0` / `Ctrl+=` – Zoom Controls

### Copy & Paste
- `Ctrl+Shift+C` – Copy HTML/Code
- `Ctrl+Shift+D` – Copy CSS
- `Ctrl+Shift+V` – Type Clipboard Content

### AI Model
- Uses Groq Llama 4 Maverick vision model

All shortcuts are global and undetectable by browsers or other applications.

## Real-World Use Cases

### Case 1: The Timed Coding Challenge

You're in a 45-minute HackerRank assessment. The problem is complex, and you're stuck on the optimal approach.

**With CheatSheet AI:**
1. Press `Ctrl+D` to capture the problem
2. Get an optimized solution with Big-O analysis in 10-15 seconds
3. Understand the approach from the detailed explanation
4. Implement it in your own style
5. Use `Ctrl+Shift+C` to copy key code snippets if needed

**Time saved:** 15-20 minutes that you can use to refine your solution or tackle bonus questions.

### Case 2: The Web Design Interview

You need to recreate a complex UI mockup in 30 minutes.

**With CheatSheet AI:**
1. Capture the design with `Ctrl+H`
2. Process with `Ctrl+Enter`
3. Get complete HTML structure with `Ctrl+Shift+C`
4. Get matching CSS with `Ctrl+Shift+D`
5. Use `Ctrl+Shift+V` to type it into the paste-restricted editor
6. Customize and refine

**Result:** A pixel-perfect implementation in a fraction of the time.

### Case 3: The Debugging Nightmare

Your code works locally but fails the test cases. The error message is cryptic.

**With CheatSheet AI:**
1. Capture your code with `Ctrl+H`
2. Capture the error message with `Ctrl+H` again
3. Process both with `Ctrl+Enter`
4. Get a detailed analysis of what's wrong
5. Receive corrected code with explanations

**Outcome:** You understand the bug and fix it properly, not just patch it.

## Privacy and Security: Your Data Stays Yours

In an era where data privacy is paramount, CheatSheet AI takes a different approach:

- **No Account Required**: No sign-ups, no email collection, no user tracking
- **Local Processing**: All screenshot handling happens on your machine
- **Direct API Calls**: Your data goes straight from your computer to your chosen AI provider
- **No Middleman**: We never see your code, your questions, or your solutions
- **Open Source**: Audit the code yourself – it's all on GitHub

Compare this to subscription services where:
- Your code passes through their servers
- They may log your usage for "quality improvement"
- You have no visibility into what happens to your data
- You're trusting a black box with sensitive interview content

## Technical Architecture: Built for Developers, By Developers

CheatSheet AI is built with modern web technologies:

**Frontend:**
- React + TypeScript for type-safe UI development
- Tailwind CSS for rapid, responsive styling
- Radix UI for accessible, customizable components
- Vite for lightning-fast builds

**Backend:**
- Electron for cross-platform desktop functionality
- Native screenshot APIs for reliable capture
- Global keyboard hooks for undetectable shortcuts
- Local configuration management

**AI Integration:**
- Modular API client for Groq vision models
- Vision API support for screenshot analysis
- Streaming responses for real-time feedback
- Error handling and retry logic

## Customization: Make It Your Own

Because CheatSheet AI is open source, you can customize everything:

### Add New AI Models

1. Add your API client in `electron/ProcessingHelper.ts`
2. Update the UI in `src/components/Settings/SettingsDialog.tsx`
3. Configure your model parameters

The modular design means you can add new providers without breaking existing functionality.

### Modify the UI

Don't like the color scheme? Want different keyboard shortcuts? It's all configurable:

- Tailwind classes for styling
- Keyboard shortcuts in `electron/shortcuts.ts`
- Window behavior in `electron/main.ts`
