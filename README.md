### Customization Possibilities

The codebase is designed to be adaptable:

- **AI Models**: Currently supports Groq API. You can modify the code to integrate with other providers like Deepseek, OpenAI, or any model with an API. All integration code is in `electron/ProcessingHelper.ts` and UI settings are in `src/components/Settings/SettingsDialog.tsx`.
- **Languages**: Add support for additional programming languages
- **Features**: Extend the functionality with new capabilities 
- **UI**: Customize the interface to your preferences

All it takes is modest JavaScript/TypeScript knowledge and understanding of the API you want to integrate.

## Running the Application

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/greeneu/cheatsheet-ai.git
cd cheatsheet-ai
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. **RECOMMENDED**: Clean any previous builds:

```bash
npm run clean
```

4. Run the appropriate script for your platform:

**For Windows:**
```bash
stealth-run.bat
```

**For macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Make the script executable first
chmod +x stealth-run.sh
./stealth-run.sh
```

**IMPORTANT**: The application window will be invisible by default! Use `Ctrl+B` (or `Cmd+B` on Mac) to toggle visibility.

### Building Distributable Packages

To create installable packages for distribution:

**For macOS (DMG):**
```bash
npm run package-mac
```

**For Windows (Installer):**
```bash
npm run package-win
```

The packaged applications will be available in the `release` directory.

**What the scripts do:**
- Create necessary directories for the application
- Clean previous builds to ensure a fresh start
- Build the application in production mode
- Launch the application in invisible mode

### Notes & Troubleshooting

- **Window Manager Compatibility**: Some window management tools (like Rectangle Pro on macOS) may interfere with the app's window movement. Consider disabling them temporarily.

- **API Usage**: Be mindful of your API key's rate limits and credit usage. Vision API calls are more expensive than text-only calls.

- **LLM Customization**: You can easily customize the app to include additional LLMs by modifying the API calls in `ProcessingHelper.ts` and related UI components.

- **Common Issues**:
  - Run `npm run clean` before starting the app for a fresh build
  - Use `Ctrl+B`/`Cmd+B` multiple times if the window doesn't appear
  - Adjust window opacity with `Ctrl+[`/`]` or `Cmd+[`/`]` if needed
  - For macOS: ensure script has execute permissions (`chmod +x stealth-run.sh`)

## Tech Stack

- Electron
- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Radix UI Components
- Groq API

## How It Works

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Launch the invisible window
   - Enter your Groq API key in the settings
   - Choose your preferred AI provider and model for extraction, solution generation, and debugging

2. **Capturing Problem**
   - Use global shortcut `Ctrl/Cmd + H` (or `Ctrl/Cmd + M`) to take screenshots of code problems
   - Screenshots are automatically added to the queue (up to 2)
   - Remove the last screenshot with `Ctrl/Cmd + Backspace` if needed

3. **Processing**
   - Press `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter` to analyze the screenshots
   - AI extracts problem requirements from the screenshots using Vision API
   - The model generates an optimal solution based on the extracted information
   - All analysis is done using your personal API key

4. **Solution & Debugging**
   - View the generated solutions with detailed explanations
   - Copy code to clipboard with `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + C`
   - Use debugging feature by taking more screenshots of error messages or code
   - Get structured analysis with identified issues, corrections, and optimizations
   - Toggle between solutions and queue views as needed

5. **Window Management**
   - Move window using `Ctrl/Cmd + Arrow keys`
   - Toggle visibility with `Ctrl/Cmd + B` or `Ctrl/Cmd + I`
   - Adjust opacity with `Ctrl/Cmd + [` and `Ctrl/Cmd + ]`
   - Zoom in/out with `Ctrl/Cmd + =` and `Ctrl/Cmd + -`, reset with `Ctrl/Cmd + 0`
   - Window remains invisible to specified screen sharing applications
   - Start a new problem using `Ctrl/Cmd + R`

6. **Model**
   - Uses Groq Llama 4 Maverick vision model
   - Your preferences are saved between sessions

7. **Language Selection**
   - Easily switch between programming languages with a single click
   - Use arrow keys for keyboard navigation through available languages
   - The system dynamically adapts to any languages added or removed from the codebase
   - Your language preference is saved between sessions

## Adding More AI Models

This application is built with extensibility in mind. You can easily add support for additional LLMs alongside the existing integrations:

- Uses Groq API Llama 4 Maverick vision model
- You can add Deepseek, Grok, Llama, or any other AI model as alternative options
- The application architecture allows for multiple LLM backends to coexist
- Users have the freedom to choose their preferred AI provider

To add new models, simply extend the API integration in `electron/ProcessingHelper.ts` and add the corresponding UI options in `src/components/Settings/SettingsDialog.tsx`. The modular design makes this straightforward without disrupting existing functionality.

## Configuration

- **API Key**: Your personal API key is stored locally and only used for API calls to your chosen provider
- **AI Provider**: Uses Groq API
- **Model Selection**: You can choose different models for each stage of processing:
  - Problem Extraction: Analyzes screenshots to understand the coding problem
  - Solution Generation: Creates optimized solutions with explanations
  - Debugging: Provides detailed analysis of errors and improvement suggestions
- **Language**: Select your preferred programming language for solutions
- **Window Controls**: Adjust opacity, position, and zoom level using keyboard shortcuts
- **All settings are stored locally** in your user data directory and persist between sessions
